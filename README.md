# **Qu**Playground

A new way to test your ideas about quantum circuit. 

## A brief user guide

## Examples

## Bell test

A Bell test experiment or Bell's inequality experiment, also simply a Bell test, is a real-world physics experiment . In this demonstration you can see the interesting result when measuring a pair of EPR.

## Shor algorithm

Shor's algorithm, named after mathematician Peter Shor, is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization.  In this demonstration we implement a simple case for N = 3 * 5 to show some features of quantum computing like undeterministic.

## Quantum teleportation

Quantum teleportation is a process by which quantum information from one location to another.  In this demonstration you will see that first bit is "teleported" to the third bit. (You can change the first bit, run it again and again, and use the result of measurement to check that.)

## Features

- Purely JavaScript 
  - which means cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Android/iOS...)
- Build from the bottom 
  - from complex number, matrix, qubit ... all way to the top
  - less dependency (GoJS for diagrams, Bootstrap for good looking... and no more)
  - a set of useful tools (Qubit, Qstat...to help you easily manage quantum state)
  - common Qgates (Pauli-X/Y/Z, Hadamard, C_U, SWAP) with relatively easy setup
- Easy to tweak (without having to write a lot of code)
  - serialize to save and load your model
  - a convenient and intuitive GUI to build quantum circuit
